# blues-io-asset-tracking
**Tagline :** Low-Power Cellular based Asset Tracking solution made using BluesWireless hardware and Edge Impulse.

**Short Description :** Asset tracking has been a demanding solution since the past decade. People have tried using IoT to solve the same but in some cases that doesn't does the work. With the advacnement of Low-Power Machine Learning technology now its possible to run high-end ML models in even a microcontroller with just 32kb of RAM. This not only provides a wider dimension in AI but also opens up a large number of use cases which can be easily and efficiently solved now. 

In this project you will be able to make a fully fledged device which will be able to run constanlty for many years on extreme low power(even on AA batteries). We will be using cellular with Edge Impulse for doing the same.
