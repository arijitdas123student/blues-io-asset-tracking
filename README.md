# blues-io-asset-tracking
**Tagline :** Low-Power Cellular based Asset Tracking solution made using BluesWireless hardware and Edge Impulse.

**Short Description :** Asset tracking has been a demanding solution since the past decade. People have tried using IoT to solve the same but in some cases that doesn't does the work. With the advacnement of Low-Power Machine Learning technology now its possible to run high-end ML models in even a microcontroller with just 32kb of RAM. This not only provides a wider dimension in AI but also opens up a large number of use cases which can be easily and efficiently solved now. 
In this project you will be able to make a fully fledged device
